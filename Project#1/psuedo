assumes all processes are provided in ascending order time

time = 0
ProcessesLeft = len(processes)//used to know how many process are left to complete, once this hits 0 we stop the time loop
//Time runs until all process have been completed
While ProcessesLeft > 0 {
readyQueue = make([]string, len(processes)) //create queue with a size = to processes slice

for i := range processes {
    if processes[i].arrivalTime == time { //if its arival time is reached we can add it to the queue

    }
}


//





**jobs are put into queue as they come**
